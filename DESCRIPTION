Description: A single, phenome-wide permutation of large-scale biobank data.
    When a large number of phenotypes are analyzed in parallel, a single 
    permutation across all phenotypes followed by genetic association analyses 
    of the permuted data enables estimation of false discovery rates (FDRs) 
    across the phenome. These FDR estimates provide a significance criterion 
    for interpreting genetic associations in a biobank context. For the basic
    permutation of unrelated samples, this package takes a sample-by-variable 
    file with ID, genotypic covariates, phenotypic covariates, and phenotypes 
    as input. For data with related samples, it also takes a file with 
    sample pair-wise identity-by-descent information. 
    The function outputs a permuted sample-by-variable file ready 
    for genome-wide association analysis. See Annis et al. (2021) <doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-873449/v1> 
    for details.
